I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Prof.Jinyuan Jia](https://jinyuan-jia.github.io/). My research focuses on LLM Security, AI agents and Evaluation.

I received my B.Eng in Computer Science from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2024.



## Research Interest
My research focuses on developing secure and reliable LLMs and AI agents. I study both the vulnerabilities and defense / alignment of LLMs, with a particular focus on prompt injection. I also work on evaluating LLMs and AI agents under realistic and comprehensive settings.

* **Prompt Injection Attacks and Defenses:** I study how prompt injection affects LLM behavior and design efficient and effective defenses against these attacks.
* **LLM Alignment and Post-Training:** My research leverages post-training RL to further improve LLM robustness without degrading utility.
* **Evaluation and Benchmarking:** I build systematic evaluation pipelines to assess LLMs and AI agents.
