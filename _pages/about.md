I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Pennsylvania State University, advised by [Prof.Jinyuan Jia](https://jinyuan-jia.github.io/). My research focuses on AI Security & Trustworthy LLM.

I received my B.Eng in Computer Science from [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2024.



## Current research focuses
* LLM Agent Security
* Prompt Injection Attacks & Defenses (Detection & Prevention)
* Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Security
* Language Modeling, Post Training, Chat Template Manipulation, etc.
